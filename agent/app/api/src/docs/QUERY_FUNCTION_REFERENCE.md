## üí¨ Natural Language to Function Mapping

The Mastra agent should be able to interpret these natural language queries:

| User Says | Agent Calls |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Show me unprofitable customers" | `getNegativeMarginsByCustomer()` |
| "Which products lose money" | `getNegativeMarginsBySKU()` |
| "Customer X profitability" | `getCustomerProfitability(customerCode: 'X')` |
| "Best products by margin" | `getProductPerformance(sortBy: 'margin')` |
| "Dashboard for Q1 2024" | `getExecutiveDashboard(startDate: '2024-01-01', endDate: '2024-03-31')` |
| "What's broken?" | `getProblemAreasReport()` |
| "Margin trends" | `getMarginTrend()` |
| "Are we overcharging anyone?" | `getPriceVarianceAnalysis()` |
| "Return problems" | `getReturnAnalysis()` |
| "Who might churn?" | `getCustomerChurnRisk()` |
| "Products to discontinue" | `getSlowMovingProducts()` |
| "Bundle opportunities" | `getCrossSellOpportunities()` |

## üìù Notes for Agent Design

1. **Default Behaviors:**
   - Exclude returns/samples unless specifically requested
   - Use last 12 months if no date range specified
   - Limit results to top 10/20 unless user asks for more
   - Use standardized customer names

2. **Smart Combinations:**
   - When asked about "customer problems", combine profitability + churn risk + return analysis
   - When asked about "pricing issues", combine variance + consistency + discount analysis
   - When asked about "product portfolio", combine performance + mix + slow-moving

3. **Context Awareness:**
   - Track conversation context to avoid redundant queries
   - Reference previous results when making comparisons
   - Suggest related analyses based on findings

4. **Data Quality:**
   - Always mention if data is missing (e.g., products without cost data)
   - Flag anomalies when found
   - Use corrected values by default

## üöÄ Getting Started

**For the agent developer:**

1. Start with the 6 critical functions in Phase 1
2. Create corresponding Mastra tools that wrap these functions
3. Test with natural language queries from the mapping table above
4. Expand to Phase 2 functions based on usage patterns

**For the business user:**

1. Start with simple queries like "Show me unprofitable customers"
2. Use the "Common Use Cases" section for multi-step analyses
3. Combine findings from multiple queries for deeper insights
4. Reference specific customers/products by code when drilling down
