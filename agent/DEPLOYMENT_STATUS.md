# Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
- Created with NIXPACKS builder configuration
- Build command: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
- Start command: `pnpm start`
- Health check endpoint configured: `/api/health`
- Restart policy: ON_FAILURE with max 10 retries

### 2. Environment Variables Template (`.env.example`)
- Documented all required Azure OpenAI credentials
- Added NODE_ENV configuration
- Included optional deployment URL variable

### 3. Health Check Endpoint (`app/api/health/route.ts`)
- Created REST endpoint for Railway health monitoring
- Returns JSON status with timestamp
- Configured in railway.json with 300s timeout

### 4. Production Build Verification
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed successfully
- ‚úÖ Production build completed without errors
- ‚úÖ Database file confirmed (92MB in public/)
- ‚úÖ All routes compiled correctly including health check
- ‚úÖ Static pages generated successfully

### 5. Deployment Documentation
- Created comprehensive deployment guide (`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
- Includes step-by-step Railway CLI instructions
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Cost and performance considerations

## üìã Files Created/Modified

1. `/workspace/agent/railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
2. `/workspace/agent/.env.example` - Environment variables template
3. `/workspace/agent/app/api/health/route.ts` - Health check endpoint
4. `/workspace/agent/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment instructions
5. `/workspace/agent/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - This file

## üöÄ Ready for Deployment

Your application is now fully configured and ready for Railway deployment.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# 2. Login to Railway
railway login

# 3. Navigate to project
cd /workspace/agent

# 4. Initialize Railway project
railway init

# 5. Set environment variables
railway variables set AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME=your-resource-name
railway variables set AZURE_API_KEY=your-api-key
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production

# 6. Deploy
railway up

# 7. View logs
railway logs
```

### What Happens During Deployment

1. **Upload**: Code is uploaded to Railway
2. **Dependencies**: `pnpm install` runs, compiling native dependencies
3. **Build**: `next build` creates production build
4. **Deploy**: Application starts with `pnpm start`
5. **Health Check**: Railway monitors `/api/health` endpoint
6. **Database**: 92MB SQLite database served from `/voltura_data_cleaned.db`

### Post-Deployment Testing

1. Visit the Railway-provided URL
2. Verify database downloads in browser (92MB, cached in IndexedDB)
3. Test chat interface with sample queries
4. Confirm agent tools are working
5. Check streaming responses

## üìù Configuration Details

### Database Handling
- **Size**: 92MB SQLite database
- **Location**: `public/voltura_data_cleaned.db`
- **Delivery**: Served statically by Next.js
- **Caching**: Browser IndexedDB (implemented)
- **Impact**: Initial page load includes database download

### Native Dependencies
- `better-sqlite3` for server-side operations
- Compiled automatically by Railway's NIXPACKS builder
- Configuration in `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` ensures proper builds

### Environment Variables Required
- `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` - Your Azure OpenAI resource name
- `AZURE_API_KEY` - Your Azure OpenAI API key
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Sets production mode

### Next.js Configuration
- Server external packages configured for SQLite libraries
- Webpack configured to exclude fs/path/crypto on client
- sql.js marked as client-only (browser-based queries)

## üîç Next Steps

Follow the detailed instructions in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to:
1. Install Railway CLI
2. Login and initialize project
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy application
5. Verify deployment

## üí° Tips

- **First deployment** may take 5-10 minutes for dependency compilation
- **Database caching** improves load time after first visit
- **Health checks** ensure automatic restart on failures
- **Logs** available via `railway logs` command or dashboard
- **Free tier** may have limitations - monitor usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

See `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide covering:
- Build failures
- Database loading issues
- Agent response problems
- Performance optimization

**Status**: ‚úÖ All automated configuration complete
**Next Action**: Follow Railway CLI deployment steps in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
